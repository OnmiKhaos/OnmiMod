This is a minor modding project just adding things I think would be cool.

The Boon of Iomedae
Have you ever been playing an Angel or Azata run of Wrath and felt "I really don't think it's in-character to take the Profane Ascension" But then your reward for denying the devil is an okay Longsword at the very end of the game you get to use for 6 rooms? I thought so too, thus, I made the Boon of Iomedae. For denying Nocticula's gift when offered, Iomedae will give you her boon, which is the Profane Ascension but Untyped!
